CS 310 Midterm Exam
===================
This exam is worth 15 points and has 3 "questions", each represented by a unit
test. Successfully manipulating the repository is worth 3 points. Each question
is worth 4 points. The first 2 questions have the unit tests fully specified, and 
you must implement the ConnectFour class methods to ensure that they pass correctly.
The final question only has a meaningful unit test name. You must create the
unit tests to satisfy the name and then implement the ConnectFour class methods
so that the test passes correctly.
